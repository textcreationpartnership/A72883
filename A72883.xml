            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>forme of our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which the inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our wil doth follow, is</hi> vniuerſall; <hi>vnder which, many particulers are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And ſo, for as much as the acts conſiſt in thoſe particulars, amongſt which there is none which can equall the power of an</hi> vniuerſall; <hi>there remaineth a kind of inclination of the will, which carrieth it ſelfe</hi> indeterminately <hi>to ſeueral things.</hi> For vpon a deſire, which a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues of health, he beginnes to conſult, about thoſe things, which ſeeme to conduce vnto it; and at length, he reſolues to take a potion. So that Counſaile precedes the reſolution of taking the potion; which proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his willingnes to be counſelled. If any thing be therfore apprehended, (according to all thoſe particulars, which may be apprehended) as a conuenient good, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily moue the will. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence it is, that a man doth neceſſarily deſire <hi>Beatitude,</hi> which is a <hi>State complete by the aggregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all good things,</hi> as hath beèn ſaid.</p>
            <p>Now, that the <hi>Wil,</hi> is carried to any thing which is preſented to it, rather according to one particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which it hath, then to another, may happen eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially vpon any one of three occaſions. First when the thing it ſelfe is of more weight; and then a man is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards it, according to reaſon. As when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs, that which reſpects his health, before that which reſpects his pleaſure. Secondly, when he conſiders of
<pb facs="tcp:150704:6"/>ſome particular circumstance, and not of another; as when a man will needs borrow money, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he shall be able to repay it. And thirdly, it may happen, by the diſpoſition of the mans mind at that tyme; becauſe (according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) <hi>As any man is in himſelfe, ſuch doth his end then ſeeme, to him to be.</hi> And ſo we ſee, that the wil of a man is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued towards any thing, after a very different manner, when he is much tranſported by choller, to what he is, when he is quiet.</p>
            <p>But, the while, it eaſily appeares, how noble theſe two <hi>Faculties</hi> are, of the <hi>Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding</hi> &amp; the Wil; &amp; how greedy and earnest they will be ſure to be, in ſlying with a fierce kind of appetite, towards their ſeuerall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. And as a man cannot fayle to be happy, according to his mayne deſire, if theſe faculties be well addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by the particuler meanes which conduce to it; So by any diſorder which they fall into, their Maiſter groweth to be miſerable. Such diſorder vſeth to ariue, vpon the allurement of ſome <hi>particular obiects,</hi> and the cloſe quarter which is kept, betweene the <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,</hi> &amp; the <hi>will,</hi> which are not only neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but greater friends, then many would perhaps imagine, and ſo they make a mighty impreſsion vpon one another. And howſoeuer, for as much as concernes the generall, and finall obiect, which is <hi>Beatitude,</hi> though neither of them, can any more perſwade the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to erre willingly, then it ſelfe can be ſubiect therin to errour; yet, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> when there is queſtion of the particular addreſſe, or meanes, there vſeth to grow much abuſe. And as, if the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> looke vpon things in a falſe light, or (as it were) through the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </note> S. <hi>Auguſtine, are ſinnes committed, when thou, O God art forſaken, O thou fountaine of life, who art the ſole and true creat our of al things; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by a fooliſh, and particular pride of appetite, we grow to loue that, which is but a part of the whole, and which with all is falſe. But by h<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble deuotion, we returne to thee againe; &amp; thou doſt cleanſe vs from our euill cuſtome; and art mercifull to the ſinnes of ſuch as confeſſe them; and thou heareſt the groanes of thy priſoners; and doſt take off the fetters which we made for our ſelues. But ſo, as that yet we muſt no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the proud hornes of falſe liberty, againſt thee; through a couetous deſire of enioying more, which wil proue to be the loſſe of what we haue already; if we loue our owne preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded priuate good, more then thee, who art the common good of all.</hi>

            <p>So that now we ſee, how neceſſary it will be for vs to take ſome courſe, for the coupling of theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes (which, on the one ſide, is our ſelues, and on the

            <p>For the errours of the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> are da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours alſo of the <hi>will,</hi> are at least, as dangerous as thoſe others; for this is the ſeat, and Center of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and it is both extremely laborious, &amp; withall very lickerish after all the delightfull obiects which it lookes vpon. And for liſtening, &amp; gazing it growes first to cheapning, &amp; then to buying; &amp; by the diſorder, &amp; diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered heate therof, it blowes with vehemet deſire v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. And ſo it rayſeth a dust into the eye of the <hi>vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,</hi> wherby it is made, as blind almost, as the blind <hi>will</hi> it ſelfe. And wherby it growes perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that how deere ſoeùer that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit ware do cost, it may proue a kind of ſauing bargaine to vs, in the end.</p>
            <p>Now, what a caſe are we therfore in, if our Loue, being ſo reſtles a thing, as it is, &amp; ſo reſolued, to be euer feeding vpon ſome obiect or other, we ſuffer that to be ſuch a one, as beſides the endles tormes of the next life, can neuer bring vs to any true reſt in this? For the ſoule can neuer rest in the poſſeſsion or fruition of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb facs="tcp:150704:7"/>The reaſon heerof is playne; becauſe the rest of any thing conſiſteth in the attayning &amp; inioying of that last end, to which it was ordayned, in the creation therof. And therfore the ſoule of man, being made for the fruition of God, whoſe glorious viſion is only able to make vs ſay, <hi>It is inough;</hi> what meruaile is it, that it can take no laſting true contentment, in any thing which is leſse then God?</p>
            <p>The holy <hi>S.

For the ſoule deſires to feed vpon ſuch a meat, as may carry proportion to it ſelfe. Now, the entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, carry no proportion at all to the ſoule, in the way of giuing it entiere ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the ſoule is ſpirituall, &amp; immortall; and all theſe obiects, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall, or carnall. And therfore, as he who were ready to ſtarue for lacke of meate, would be ridiculous if he should thinke to kill his hungar, by going to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, &amp; gaping there like ſome <hi>Camelion,</hi> to take in the ayre (which ayre is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent and proportionable food, for a body of flesh &amp; bloud;) iuſt ſo a man who shal pretend to ſatisfy &amp; fulfill the deſires of a ſpirituall &amp; immortal ſubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (as we know the ſoule to be) by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fowly vpon the Carrion of Corporall thinges, is at least as very a foole as the former. And beſides his folly, &amp; his loſſe of labour in the meane time, he wil, heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, grow to ſuffer by it, ſo much more; he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the otherr; as the eternall da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of a ſoule, is a matter inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably more conſiderable, then the death of a mortall body.</p>
            <p>No; it is God alone, who can que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch the infini e ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of his reaſonable creatures. He alone made the whole world for vs; &amp; vs for himſelf; &amp; he only is our
<pb facs="tcp:150704:8"/>Center, &amp; place of reſt. He only is that first <hi>Truth,</hi> which our <hi>vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding</hi> should aſpire to <hi>know;</hi> &amp; the only <hi>Good,</hi> which our <hi>Will</hi> should be ſo inflamed to <hi>Loue.</hi> And becauſe as hath bene ſaid, the queſtion is, but of the <hi>Meanes,</hi> wherby we muſt tend to this moſt perfect <hi>End:</hi> and for that, by the treachery of our ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes, we are induced to place our harts, &amp; the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therof vpon da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, &amp; vicious <hi>obiects;</hi> it is therfore, shat I am procuring to ſet that one before vs, which is the moſt ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, &amp; ſweet, &amp; perfect <hi>meanes,</hi> &amp; which may not only inuite, but aſsiſt vs alſo admirably otherwiſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ariuing to our <hi>laſt End.</hi>

            <p>The line which leades to this faire full point, &amp; the way which guides vs to this eternall habitation, is that top of beauty, and excellency, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> vpon whom if we can perſwade our ſelues to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the rootes of allour <hi>Loue,</hi> we shall not only be happy there, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heere.

But yet by the great mercy of God, it is made a rare caſe with theſe his ſeruants, to be put vpon thoſe extreme dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, (vnleſſe it be amongſt Heretikes, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150704:97"/>Pagans) in the exerciſe of this function, from which his ardent loue, would neuer giue him leaue to be free. For euen from his firſt, to his laſt Baptiſme, (that is, from the Baptiſme of water in the Riuer of Iordan, to the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, in the bloud of that <hi>Imaculat clambe,</hi> which was himſelfe, vpon Mount <hi>Caluary</hi>) he went, teaching vp and downe the world, in a kind of perpetuall motion: And was ſubiect to a moſt vnkind continuall perſecution, by the moſt part of them, whome he did moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly apply himſelfe to inſtruct, and teach.</p>
               <p>It is true, that his Apoſtles, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, did follow him throughout, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme affection and admiration; but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they were ſo very ignorant and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as could haue giuen no pleaſure in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, to any other, but to Chriſt our Lord.

And yet our Lord IESVS, was dayly in conuerſation with ſuch as theſe. Who knew not how to gather the fruit of that tree of his diuine wiſedome; though the weight therof, did make the braunches ſtoope ſo low, as that they might be, within their reach. How<note n="(c)" place="margin">The great meeknes of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</note> meekely did he liue in their ſight; which was a kind of moſt effectual Doctrine.

               <p>And all this he did, in the midſt of a thouſand corporall incomodities, of labour, and hungar; when after the day was ſpent in continuall pennance, the nights would lay hold on him without a lodging. <hi>The Foxes had holes,</hi>

But (to the conſuſion of impatient men who are angry euen with their beſt friends, when they change to be) pinched otherwiſe, he was farre from caring for any other habitation; but only that he might dwell in the hartes of men by loue.</p>

He lets men know, withall, that for no reſpect they muſt breake the least tittle of the law of God. That men must not be angry, nor giue any iniurious word to others. That we must not conſent, to ſo much as the leaſt dishoneſt thought. That no man or woman must be diuorced, vpon the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of leſſe then Fornication; and that neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shall marry againe till the other dye.

And that whoſo euer will be ſo, must ſell all that he hath, and giue it to the poore, and follow our Lord; and that ſuch a one, shall haue his treaſure in heauen. That if any man would come after our Lord, he muſt deny himſelfe, and take vp his Croſſe and follow him; For he that would ſaue his life should looſe it, and he

But ſo it muſt be conſidered, that he who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it, doth withall, giue much grace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to learne it. A burthen is more or leſſe grieuous, according to the ſtrength more or leſſe, which he hath, who is to beare it.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a goodnes which is as infinite.

               <p>But yet, on the other ſide, we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, to be both poſſible and eaſy, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, as I was ſaying, the omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wiſe loue of Chriſt our Lord, the aboundant grace, which is deriued to vs from the merits of his holy life and death; the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of many Saints, who hauing bene made of the ſame metall with vs, haue, by the fauour of God and their good endeauours, tranſlated, as it were, their

And<note n="(h)" place="margin">The B.

I will alſo, in this place ſorbeare to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arken to that other diuine conſort of Muſicke, which he made in that leaſt Sermon of his, next before his ſacred Paſſion, which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> relates in his holy Ghoſpell. For that of the B. Sacrament, is conſidered in a diſcourſe therof a part; and that of the infinite loue of our Lord in his laſt Sermon, is toucht in the beginning of that, of the Paſſion. And we haue heere, I hope, bene ſhewed inough, to make the loue of our B. Lord appeare: Not only in regard of what he conceaued in his owne pretious hart, towards man; but moreouer for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant bleſſings which he hath imparted to the world exteriourly. For we ſee, to what greatnes, and happines the meaneſt of vs is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blymed, through the high account into which we are taken by Almighty God. Only we
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:150704:125"/>muſt be ſure, that his infinite goodnes do not giue vs occaſion and colour for contynuance in our wickednes. For as much as in God, all is infinite a like;<note n="(i)" place="margin">All is a like Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in God; and therfore euen the very infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe of his Mercy doth ſhew vs how Infinite his Iuſtice alſo is.</note> and euen by the exceſſe of his mercy when men are ſory for their ſinnes, we may inferre the intollerable rigour of his Iuſtice, againſt ſuch as are impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture is alſo ful of moſt particular proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, how deepely our Lord doth deteſt al ſinne and willfull ſinners. This hath bene pointed at before, vpon another occaſion in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the infinite power of God; and in the end of the Paſſion it will alſo be reſumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. For the preſent therfore, I conclude, concerning the moſt excellent Doctrine of Chriſt our Lord, deliuered eſpecially in holy Scripture; and I paſſe on to the conſideration of his Miracles.</p>

               <p>THE exceſſiue loue of our Lord Ieſus, was farre from being content, to expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe it ſelfe towards man, by any one ſingle way alone; but it was ſolliciting him in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute of his moſt holy life, to try as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as might be found for our good.

And as, by creation of the world, he led men vp, by meanes of viſible things, towards a knowledge, and beliefe of the inuiſible; ſo in the caſe of our reparation, and redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would alſo vſe the corporall cure of men from ſicknes, as a diſpoſition, wherby theyr ſoules might be recouered from ſinne.</p>
               <p>Heerby our Lord doth euidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, to be a true &amp; perfect louer of mankind. For as the property of loue, is not<note n="(b)" place="margin">The meaſure of our loue of God is to exceed all meaſure.</note> to be tyed vp within the compaſſe of any ordinary law; and the meaſure which that power v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, is to exceed all meaſure; ſo did our Lord, out of the nobility of his loue to man, refuſe to walke within ſo ſmall a circle, as the lawes of nature did lead him to. Theſe lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were made by almighty God; at the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; &amp; it is not al the power of heauen, or earth vnder him, which can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert that order.<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>148.</hi>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:150704:126"/>all things were appointed to proceed.</p>
               <p>According to the law of nature, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne is made from priuation, to the habit; as from a fixed blindnes, to ſight; and much leſſe from death, to life. But the law of the loue of our Lord IESVS, did ouertop that other law; made thoſe things grow true and ſamiliar, which otherwiſe were not only hard, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Moyſt bodies were appointed, by the law of nature to giue place, and ſuch as are heauy, and ſolid to ſinke downe below the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But yet, when there was queſtion of giuing comfort to his poore Apoſtles;<note place="margin">Matt. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> the loue of Chriſt our Lord, made him lay thoſe lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and <hi>he went walking towards them vpon the ſea,</hi> which was glad to performe the Office of a pauement, to his pretious feete.

And he paſſed out of thoſe bowells of ſupreme Purity, into thoſe armes of matchleſſe Piety, without the leaſt offence to her moſt entire Virginity. But yet in this, there is the leſſe wonder becauſe he wrought the like, in fauour of his Apoſtles; whom he loued by innumerable degrees, leſſe then his moſt excellent mother.<note place="margin">Iſa. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> For in their caſe alſo, his loue was tranſcendent in the ſelfe ſame kind, vnto his lawes. For hauing firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <p>But why doe I name thoſe perſons, who were ſo highly priuiledged; as if our Lord had only bene in loue with them; and not indeed (as yet indeed he was) enamoured of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſo farre, as to make his miracles, diſtill down vpon them, like ſo many drops of dew, for their reliefe, or comfort, in all occaſions. And although theſe miracles of Chriſt our Lord, could not haue bene wrought, but by the omnipotent power of almighty God; yet may that power be accounted to haue been but as a kind of inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherby he wrought them; and that indeed, they flowed from his loue, as from their prime cauſe and roote.</p>
               <p>He wrought no miracles for the oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his power, and therfore we ſee, how often he preciſely comaunded <hi>both men and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills,</hi>

               <p>But the whyle, though they fed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, Chriſt our Lord did not ſo; for if he had, thoſe malicious Iewes (whoſe teeth were ſharplier whet againſt him, then all the reſt, (or rather not againſt them, at all, but only in regard that they belonged to him) would haue byn ſure to haue bitten him vvith their reprehenſion. So great therfore was his neceſſity, and yet he would not ſtretch forth his arme of power to help himſelfe, by any ſupernaturall meanes.

               <p>He wrought no miracles, either by

               <p>No one ſigh was vttered by Chriſt our

               <p>VVE may wel perceaue, that our Lord IESVS, is a great freind of<note n="(a)" place="margin">God is a great friend of vnion.</note> Vnion. His perſon is diſtinct, from the other perſons of the B. Trinity, but the eſſence is one, and very ſame of them all. When he was reſolued to become man, he was alſo pleaſed to knit mans nature to the nature of God, by the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaticall vnion.</hi> An infinite honour this was to man; for it grew true heerby. that man was God; and that God was killed vpon a Croſſe, for the loue of men. Yet though by that vnion in his Incarnation, he brought vs all to be his allies, he did not perſonally vnite himſelfe to vs all. But by this laſt<note n="(b)" place="margin">How our Lord vniteth vs to himſelf.</note> ſacramentall vnion of him and vs, when purely we take his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious body &amp; bloud into our ſelues, vnder the quality and condition of food; he maketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs, much more one with him. And then no meruaile, if the honour he doth vs, &amp;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:150704:148"/>if the ioy he giues vs, (when the fault is not our owne) be the greateſt which we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in this world. For we inioye none of the other myſteries of the life, and death of our Lord IESVS, but onely by faith, and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; wheras this, is preſent to vs, in very deed; and preſent ſo, as the food which we receaue, is preſent to vs.</p>
               <p>And ſo, in like manner, when no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment is at hand, it breeds a great loue of his goodnes, and a great delight in his ſweetnes, &amp; in fine, an vnion of vs both, in one. Though with this difference from other food, that (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was taught by our Lord) <hi>we change not him into vs,</hi>

               <p>Nor is it ſtrange that we ſhould both feed, and yet be fed vpon, when Almighty God is a party to the contract: <hi>Omnia quaecum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pue voluit fecit:</hi> He can doe what he will; and he is pleaſed to will,<note place="margin">Pſalm. <hi>113.</hi>
                  </note> that he, and we, ſhould feed vpon one another. And to ſuch, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to be truly, and entirely, and purely his; he contenteth not himſelfe with leſſe then thus to come to them in perſon, with deſire of vnion. And he is<note n="(c)" place="margin">The vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which are reaped by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the B.

He is thawing all frozen hardnes of the hart by the ſweet breath of his Spirit; <hi>Flabit Spiritus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius &amp; fluent aquae;</hi> and he is conſuming the ruſt
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:150704:148"/>of their ſelfe loue, by that burning fire of his charity; comforting them in all afflictions and ſatisfying them in all their doubts and wants; illuminating their vnderſtanding; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their will; and fixing their imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and poſſeſſing, and imprinting himſelfe vpon their memory; calling in, and conſecrating their ſenſes; and ſealing vp their harts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

               <p>AS the loue of our Lord IESVS, was full of inuention, in diſpoſing him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this worke; ſo<note n="(a)" place="margin">The great loue of our Lord, doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably appeare by diuers circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> was it alſo, in the manner of contriuing, and diſpenſing it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity of man. And firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the formes or ſpecies, vnder which he is preſented to vs, what other, could haue bene thought of, either more agreable, or more guſtful to the nature of man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they of bread &amp; wine? If, for the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our ſinnes, or the mortification of our ſenſes, he had bene pleaſed to ordaine, that we ſhould haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, in the formes of pitch, or inke; as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would therby haue bene ſubiect to no indignity at all; ſo yet ſtill we muſt haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that it had bene infinite mercy for vs to haue receiued ſuch a pretious Iewell as that, in how courſe, or homely caſe ſoeuer, it had come.</p>
               <p>But bread and wine, are the very ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of corporall ſtrength, and comfort; and he confined his body and bloud, to the ſpecies of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:150704:151"/>theſe two creatures; that ſo this ſuperſcription (as it were) of the Loue-letter which he was writing to vs, might prepare vs, for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of thoſe ſublime, and ſweet conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which lay within. Yet<note n="(b)" place="margin">The Bloud of our Lord, is alwayes together with his body; and for that reaſon, it was necſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for lay people to receaue both the body and the bloud diſtinct. Nay there are many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which make it neyther conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor yet poſſible to receaue them ſo.</note> becauſe there are ſome, who haue a naturall auerſion from the taſt, and euen from the very ſent of vvine, which no man euer had, from bread; Becauſe there are ſome countries, ſo remote, both from the Sunne, and from the Sea, as that there, wine is hardly to be found; Becauſe in the infinite multitudes of Chriſtians, it would be impoſſible, for all to receaue of the ſacred Chalice, without indangering, yea and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting much irreuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; Becauſe ſome would be ſo ſicke of peſtilent feauers, as that euen a drop of wyne, would doe them hurt; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perſecutions would be ſometymes ſo great, as that it might be fit, to leaue the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament in the cuſtody of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, and women, to be receiued by themſelues for their comfort, in ſome great exigent of diſtreſſe, and danger (as was often done in the primitiue Church by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others) and which could not be done with the Chalice, for any long tyme, or euen almoſt at all, in any hoat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For theſe reaſons, I ſay, and for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which by the wiſedom and loue of our Lord IESVS were thought conuenient (and eſpecially becauſe his body is a liuing body (and conſequently it cannot be without the bloud) he was pleaſed, that both the bloud &amp;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:150704:152"/>the body ſhould remaine vnder the ſpecies both of bread &amp; wine, that ſo he who recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued one, might be ſure to receaue them both.</p>
               <p>And<note n="(c)" place="margin">In the ſacrifice of the Maſſe the reaſon is very different.</note> howſoeuer, for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, both the bread and wine are ſeueraly to be offered, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conſummated by the Prieſt (for in theſe three acts, the ſubſtance of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice doth confiſt, and not in the prayers, or Scriptures, which doe either precede or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or interlace them, ſince theſe latter, doe but ſerue as an addition for deuotion, &amp; for a ſpirituall ornament to that high action. For as much, I ſay, as this Sacrifice which is dayly offered vp, vpon the Altar, is to be a moſt liuely repreſentation of the bloudy Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of our Lord, vpon the Croſſe (a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for as much as concernes the manner of it, but no repreſentation for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the thinge, becauſe both the one, and the other, is but only one, and the very ſelfe ſame Sacrifice) yet when there is only queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of receauing the bleſſed body and bloud of our Lord' IESVS in the nature of a Sacrament, the ſame Lord was pleaſed<note n="(d)" place="margin">The Church is to ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, according to that ſpirit of diſcretion which reigneth in it.</note> to leaue it, to that ſpirit of diſcretion, wherwith he would emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly indue his Church; to ordaine when it ſhould be conuenient (for neceſſary it could no way be) to vſe both the bread &amp; the wine diſtinct, and when but the one of them alone.</p>
               <p>It is alſo well obſerued, by ſpirituall writers, that the very ſpecies of bread and wine, doe inuite, and beſpeake our ſoules, to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:150704:152"/>a very intrinſecall vnion, both with God, and our neighbour. In theſe ſpecies, we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there is an vnion of two ſorts. The one of them, hauing bene ſetled by nature, &amp; the other growing on, by induſtry, or art. The naturall<note n="(e)" place="margin">Two kinds of vnion which are ſhewed by bread &amp; wine.</note> vnion conſiſteth in this; That many graynes doe grow vpon one eare of corne; and many grapes vpon one cluſter of the vine, with great reſemblance to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The artificiall vnion, which is made betwene them doth defeate the former natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnion; that ſo, that former, may become more perfect. For firſt by plucking off, or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the grapes, or breaking and grinding the graynes of Corne; and then, by ſeparating the chaff, and husks, and branne, and skinnes, &amp; ſtones, it growes to be one paſte, or liquor, which is perfected, and purified afterward, by heate; the <hi>muſt</hi> by the naturall heate which it hath; and the bread by the heate of fire. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we can not know, which graine of corne in particular, was white, and which was browne, or which grape was great, &amp; which was ſmall.</p>
               <p>Theſe<note n="(f)" place="margin">How theſe two kinds of Vnion are found in men.</note> Vnions alſo there are, and are to be in men; The naturall as they are men of fleſh and bloud; and the other ſupernaturall, as they are faithfull Chriſtians, regenerated by grace, and animated therin, by his diuine Sacraments. In vertue of the former vnion, we loue our kindred and friends. And becauſe this loue, doth vſe to carry imperfection with it, through the influence of ſelfe loue, and the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:150704:153"/>mixture of temporall &amp; vayne reſpects, Chriſt our Lord commeth to vs, in this ſupernaturall Sacrament, and doth take, as it were, our ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and the deſires therof, all in peeces; caſting away that which is inordinate, vnmortified, and any way vnfit, concerning honour, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or delight, or any other earthly thing whatſoeuer; and he doth ſo boyle and bake vs in the bleſſed Sacrament by the fire of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as that we may grow to be perfectly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, both to him, and within our ſelues, and to one another. And then wil that be fulfilled which the bleſſed Apoſtle ſayth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That we are all one bread and one body, we who are partakers of that diuine bread, and of his Chalice.</hi> But though this may be truly ſaid, to ſome proportion, of all ſuch, as doe carefully and deuoutly come to this bleſſed Sacrament; yet moſt eminently is it true, of them who are fed therby, in the ſtate of holy Religion. Whoſe perfect<note n="(g)" place="margin">The vnion of religious perſons is a kind of mirocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing.</note> V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, hath ſo very much of the miracle in it, that it conuinceth euen the moſt malicious tookers on. For euen they, when they are in their wits, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not aſcribe it to any other cauſe then the powerful preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the grace of God &amp; the powerfull grace of his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that ſuch a world of perſons of ſo different &amp; incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible nations, ages, humours, deſcent, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and talents, ſhould liue together in as perfect a mutuall conſent of mind, as if they were all, the twynnes of one, and the ſame naturall mother.</p>
               <p>The<note n="(h)" place="margin">Of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which do greatly ſhew the loue of our Lord.</note> ardent loue of our Lord IESVS,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:150704:153"/>doth alſo as liuely appeare in other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this diuine Sacrifice, and Sacrament of the Altar. It is true, that ſuch as receaue Chriſt our Lord, with great purity of hart, &amp; are content (as it were) to be at coſt, and care, to adorne their ſoules, when they to be ſit at this celeſtiall Banquet; are receiued by him, with an vnſpeakeable communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and he imbraceth them with armes of ſo great delight and ioy, as is very different from what he ordinarily doth, to ſuch as approach Ieſſe deuoutly to him. At this we are not to wonder, for the loue of our Lord IESVS, to vs, is not like the loue of men, which if it be very great, it puts them, as it were, out of their wits. But the<note n="(i)" place="margin">The loue of our Lord, doth no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from his infinite wiſedom.</note> loue of our Lord God, doth not take him one haires breadth from home, nor doth it derogate at all; from his high wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome. Nor are there in the world, any weights, either of gold, or diamonds, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or nice, as the weights of the wiſedome of our Lord God, whereby he values euery thought of preparation which is made, more or leſſe, when we approach to his preſence. And accordingly he receaues vs, either like his ſeruants, or like his Sonnes. But yet ſtill this is true, that there is no perſon in ſtate of grace, who may not celebrate if he be a Prieſt, nor no other man or woman, but may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate otherwiſe of the body, and bloud, of Chriſt our Lord with great profit.</p>
               <p>This<note n="(k)" place="margin">Our Lords loue doth ſtill more and more appeare, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> Lord might haue annexed this incomparable benefit, to the only ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:150704:154"/>Chaſtity; or only to ſuch perſons as had performed certaine grieuous penances; or, at leaſt, to ſuch alone, as had neuer diſhonored or profaned either this ſoueraigne Sacrifice, or moſt venerable Sacrament, by ill receiuing it. But his Charity would not endure, that any one ſhould be excluded from ſuch a benefit, if at laſt he would be content to loue him. He might haue abridged vs to one only tyme of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in all our life; or at leaſt, that we ſhould not communicate aboue, once a yeare. But ſo farre he was, from giuing any ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint as this, that he deſires nothing more, then that we ſhould often repaire to this food of life. Yea, and he hath inſpired his holy Church, by his holy Spirit, to counſaile her children to frequent it; and to driue them out of her company by<note n="(l)" place="margin">They are exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who doe not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate once in the yeare.</note> excommunication, if at certayne tymes they doe not ſatisfye the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which he hath, to become therby, one with them.</p>
               <p>There is no neceſſity, or important occaſion in the world, either corporall, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, either publicke, or priuate; for which this holy Sacrifice may not be offered. And not only brings it profit to liuing men, but to ſuch as haue led vs the way to Purgatory; where the paines are much diſcounted heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as <hi>S. Augustine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De cura pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim.</note> and many other of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe aboundantly ſhew. So alſo, in our receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament; we of the layty, are put to no ſtint heerin; but euery Chriſtian may communicate as often, as his
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:150704:154"/>owne ghoſtly Father ſhall thinke fit.

               <p>Eſpecially it will concerne ſuch of vs, to be entirely deuouted to it, as haue much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured or prophaned this diuine Sacrament; either by any notable want of preparation before the receauing it; or of recollection af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward; and much more if when they came to this Table they examined, and looked vpon their conſcience, through the falſe ſpectacles of ſelfe loue and paſſion, and not through the cleere pure chriſtall glaſſe, of the law of God. For thus they taught themſelues to beleeue groſſe lyes inſteed of truth; and to walk in the darke, through the moſt intricate and obſcure waies of ſinne, and thereby they haue come to pollute themſelues, and prophane the holy thinges of God, and to commit as many ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as they receaued Sacraments, and they would infallibly, and moſt iuſtly haue dropt downe into hell, if our Lord had not, been infinitely mercifull towards them.</p>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:150704:160"/>but by cuſtome, and familiarity, there growes contempt. It is not, it cannot be ſo in this caſe of ours.

And although in moſt places of holy Scripture, when our Lord ſpake to his Apoſtles or Diſciples, he meant not that his words ſhould be for them alone, but that all

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:150704:182"/>the deuill more ſtronge, he fell into mortall ſinnes, and at laſt, he came, by theſe inſenſible degrees, into ſuch an Abiſſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, as it was for him to ſell, and betray his heauenly maiſter.</p>

A man who ſhootes in a weake bow, at a long marke, muſt ouer-lay; or els he will be ſure to fall ſhort. Now there is not any longer way, then from the ſinfull hart of man, to ſanctity of life; nor is there any weaker bow, then the powers of our minde, which are ſo afflicted, by ſo many ſpirituall wounds. And if any man will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, and hope, by the grace of God, neuer to commit any mortall ſinne, let him ouerlay ſo much, as to be carefull not to commit any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; &amp; ſo, and only ſo, he may perhaps keep his ſoule, from the guilt of any, which is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
               <p>But ſuch, in <hi>Iudas,</hi> was the worke of ſinne and ſuch was the treachery which he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

For<note n="(f)" place="margin">The inuincible patience, &amp; meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our Lord Ieſus.</note> in the ſtrength therof, it was, that he did not ſo much as turne his mouth aſide, from receiuing that pill of death, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Apothecary of hell. But rather he did behold the wretch, with a countenance compounded of meekenes (to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:150704:182"/>his cruelty) and of miſery, to extinguiſh his enuy. And becauſe that countenance was not of force inough to worke with him, he ſpake to him as hath bene ſaid, and he had care euen then, to ſaue his honour; and he called him Friend. Wiſhing him firſt to looke in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon himſelfe, and to reflect vpon the thing, which he was come to do, by ſaying (as I haue ſhewed) <hi>Ad quid veniſti;</hi> and when that would not ſerue, he aduiſed him (by ſaying further, <hi>Oſculo filium hominus tradis?</hi>) to looke vpon his perſon, he being the <hi>Sonne of the Virgin;</hi> and to conſider whether it were fit to betray the Sonne of ſuch a mother, and that by a kiſſe.</p>
               <p>And howſoeuer the hardnes of that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars hart were foreſeene from all eternity by the eye of God; yet the ſame eye did alſo ſee that it would be hard through his one fault; whether God (in effect) would or no.

               <p>The griefe which our Lord IESVS had, for euery ſingle ſinne of the whole world was exceſſiuely great as we haue ſhewed.

               <p>And it ſeemes to haue bene impoſſible for that diuine Lord, to haue caſt his thought vpon any creature, to whome he muſt not be ſhewing mercy. For when <hi>S.

                  <hi>That he bauing imployed himſelfe ſo much, vpon inſtructing, and teaching them, to their good liking, in the Temple; they should now come forth againſt him with ſwords, and Clubbes, as they would haue done againſt ſome inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; bloudy thieſe.</hi> As if he had ſaid. <hi>If you come indeed, to ſeeke the true Redeemer and Saniour of your ſoules, you shall find, to your comfort, that I am he.

And although the Prophet Iſay, might meane (by that great diffiguring of our Lord which he foreſaw and foretold) the whole troope of torments which came vpon his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne perſon; yet it ſeemes that this of his ſpittle, was pointed at by him, in particular manner.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture doth further ſay, that they vttered many other moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous things againſt him.

               <p>Yet whatſoeuer, they either did or ſaid, it is certaine, that the very things themſelues, were not ſo odious, in the ſight of God, as was the ground from whence they grew.

And ſo, on the other ſide, though the very outrages them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, were far more enormous then we can conceaue, which declare the infinite patience and humility of Chriſt our Lord; yet the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall hart of loue wherwith he offred them all to God, for our good, and wherwith, he (behoulding vs all at that very time) could haue bene content to ſuffer more, as afterward we ſhall ſee he did; is that which ought both to comfort, and confound vs moſt.</p>

For the tyme when they perſecuted our Lord, was the day of the greateſt ſolemnity and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the whole yeare.

And as the affronts were ſo much greater, then if they had bene done at a more priuate tyme, &amp; the malice of the high Prieſts, ſo much the more eager ſince they could not be perſwaded to put it of, to a leſſe buſy day; ſo was the loue of our Lord exceſſiue euen heerin, who was contented with the publicity of his ſhame, at that tyme; becauſe, by meanes therof, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Paſſion togeather with the miracles ſucceding it, would the more ſpeedily be ſpred; and more readily beleeued, ſhortly after, throughout the world.</p>
               <p>The circumſtance of <hi>Pilates</hi> perſon, doth plainely alſo ſhew the particular rancour of their hart; ſince they hated Chriſt our Lord ſo much, as that it made them earneſt, &amp; glad, to ſhew themſelues ſubiect to that Romane Iuſtice. They deteſted the ſubiection which they were in, to Rome; They loued not Ceſar whome they tooke to be a Tyrant, and Vſurper ouer them; they loued not <hi>Pilate,</hi> whome they knew to be a moſt corrupt, and wicked Iudge; they loued not the exerciſe of his Iudicature, which ſerued but to refreſh the memory of their owne misfortune, in their hauing loſt the vſe of that power. But their

               <p>When <hi>Pilate</hi> was come ſorth, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make their charge againſt the priſoner; accuſing him, in bitter termes, of moſt odious crimes; but ſtill (as the manner of ſuch perſons is) only in generall termes.

               <p>YET this was not all; for the ſouldiers who had receiued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion to ſcourge him in ſo bloudy manner, to the end that by that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty the pitty of the Iewes might be awaked; tooke the bouldnes, out of their owne <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priccio,</hi> to put the moſt ignominious, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all moſt bitter torment vpon him, which euer, in the world, had bene conceaued.

And becauſe the Prieſts and Elders, had charged him with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:150704:202"/>by fauour of the people, to be made a King, whome they had found by experience, to be ſo ſubiect to themſelues; they<note n="(a)" place="margin">Why they reſolued to crowne him with thornes.</note> thought it would carry a good proportion to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed cryme of his ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they could find ſome meanes, to make him a conunterfeit kind of King, and to afflict him in point both of eaſe and honor; by the appearance of all thoſe ornaments, and demonſtrations, of reſpect &amp; ſeruice, which are indeed of honour to true kings, when they are truly meant; but to him they were of exceſſiue affront, and paine.</p>

All this did Chriſt our Lord endure for vs, and he did it with a kind of infinite meekenes and loue; not complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:150704:203"/>therat, nor declaring the leaſt miſtike therof, either by pittying himſelfe or blaming them.

               <p>It ought to fill our ſoules with extreme confuſion, to find that we, who profeſſe to be the ſeruants of our Lord, are yet ſo dull in deuiſing meanes how to expreſſe our reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and loue towards him.

Yet heere, theſe enemies of God &amp; man, are teaching vs, by their lewd example, (whoſe wits did ſerue them but too well) to increaſe the torment of our Lord at an eaſy rate, vnto themſelues.

And ſo, that, being the moſt ſenſible part of al the reſt, and indeed the very ſource, and ſeate of ſenſe, the former torment was not ſo great, as it might haue bene. But heere, with hands, which they arme with iron grauntlets, they wreath ſharpe thornes, of great length, into the forme of a hat,<note place="margin">Ioan. <hi>19.</hi>

It is true that before, he had bene ſtroken, at ſeuerall tymes, in the high Prieſts houſe, both with the fiſt, and with the flat of the hand; but now his head is beaten, not with their hands (for they could not haue ſo much as touched him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding themſelues) but the Reed, which, whilſt it was in his hands, ſerued for a note of ſcorne, being taken into theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

For laying load with it vpon his head, their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſo witty, as to be able (and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any labour at all to themſelues) to make at once, as many new wounds in that moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part of the whole body, as there were thornes, in that curſed-bleſſed-Crowne.</p>
               <p>A fence of<note n="(d)" place="margin">The great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which thoſe thornes, muſt needs giue our Lord.</note> thornes made with care, is able to keepe wild beaſts within the priſon of a Parke, as well as if the incloſure, were of wood or ſtone. And although they haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which are like houſes, thatcht with hayre; yet they dare not put themſelues vpon the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſuch pikes as thoſe.

And if it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to get, betwene the fleſh, and the nayle, it makes a ſhift to goe for a kind of torment.

What torment then did our bleſſed Lord endure, when that faire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of his forehead, grew ſubiect to ſuch an incloſure of thornes, which imbraced, (as with ſo many cruell armes) not only that part, but all the reſt of his diuine head, round about?</p>
               <p>We haue ſeene men wounded in ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible partes of the body, that the Tents which are put in, doe giue them more paine euery tyme when they are dreſt, then euen the very

And who ſhall then be able to comprehend the vnſpeakeable torment which now was cauſed to our bleſſed Lord, who had ſo many wounds in that fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of his quicke feeling; and ſo many ſeuerall Tents, as there were thornes, which did not only ſearch the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds but make them.

               <p>And thus it was cleerly, and complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled of Chriſt our Lord, that; <hi>A plant a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis vſque ad verticem capitis,</hi>

                  </note> was Mount Caluary, without the citty of let uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. As he was going, his miſery ſeemed ſo great, and he was ſo disfigured with durt, and ſweate, and bloud, and ſo weakned with the exceſſe of affliction (he whome formerly the world had bene ſo much obliged to) that the obiect wrought vpon many women, who were leſſe ill diſpoſed. And as they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him in the midſt of a mighty troope of men, who went to ſee him put to death, they did bitterly bewayle his misfortune. But our Lord,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> though in his hart he accepted their compaſſion of him, in gratefull part; yet<note n="(b)" place="margin">Our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had no guſt but in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for vs.</note> through his loue to ſuffer, and to ſuffer home, for the loue of vs, he refuſed to take compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in that pitty of theirs.

Letting them know the calamities which were comming towards them and their poſterity; and that if he who was innocency it ſelfe, were ſo afflicted for the ſinnes of others, how grieuouſly ſhould men be puniſhed for their owne.</p>
               <p>This was then the aduiſe, which with perfect loue he gaue to them, and in them to vs and all the world;<note n="(c)" place="margin">Whet we are to looke for comfort in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> inſtructing vs how to ſeeke for the comfort of our afflictions, not in the pittifull teares, or moaning tongues, or fawning entertaynements of others; but in the Teſtimony of a good conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, a ſtrong hope in God, and a faithfull obedience to his holy

For they ſay, that the Greene wood (which is Chriſt our Lord) did ſuffer all, vpon his owne perſon, and that, as for them (who are dry wood) they haue nothing to ſuffer for themſelues, but that it ſufficeth to beleeue, that he ſuffered all. But heere our Lord is expreſſe in ſhewing, that our ſight of his miſeries, in the way of puniſhment, muſt ſpurre vs vp to make vs bitterly lament our owne miſeries, in the way of ſinne; and that the ſeeing or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing of thoſe afflictions endured by him for vs, would not ſerue our turne, vnleſſe we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed them to ourſoules, by true contrition.</p>
               <p>By theſe externall acts of loue, and by thoughts, when the occaſions of acting fayled, did our Lord goe wearing out, that long way betweene <hi>Pilits</hi> houſe, and Mount Caluary.

The executioners were cloſe at his heeles; the publique Cryer leading him the way, and proclayming him for a ſeditious, and a trayterous perſon in the eares of all that world.

               <p>And beſides, it is very probable, that they would accompany theſe bitter words with barbarous deeds; for what ſhould hinder them, ſince they had all power in their hands and ſuch ſprings of poyſon in their harts?

And now<note n="(a)" place="margin">The fomer ſcornes were put againe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our Lord, but with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which did much increaſe both his paine and ſhame.</note> they did the ſame againe, but with the addition of two circumſtances, which did extremely increaſe both his ſhame, and paine. For his garments

Theſe cloathes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing growne ſo faſt to his fleſh, and pluckt off, by thoſe rude hands, with as much rigor as they could tel how to vſe, muſt needs increaſe his torment to a ſtrange proportion.</p>
               <p>It could not alſo chooſe, but that his ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of ſhame was alſo rayſed to a great height. For before, that ſacred humanity was ſeene, but by as many as could throng into <hi>Pilates</hi> Court. But now, vpon the top of Mount Caluary (as if it had bene, at a kind of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day of Iudgement) Romans, Grecians, Pagans, Iewes, and they of all the Prouinces of the Eaſt, Prieſts, and people, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of all conditions, and ages, and in fine, an Epitome of the whole world, was preſent.</p>
               <p>For the increaſe of his confuſion, and to hide the hatefull ſpots of their iniuſtice, they led, in his company, two murthering theeues to execution, that<note n="(b)" place="margin">Why they lead him in the company of thee us.</note> their notorious crimes, might make ſome impreſſion or influence of bad aſpect, vpon the innocency of our Lord IESVS. And to the end that the worſt in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, might not be wanting to him, they

                  </note> as in the more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable place of infamy. This croſſe they now brought him to; and as before they laid it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, they laid him now, vpon it. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bored through. And if perhaps they had made thoſe holes, which were meant for his hands, further off from thoſe others which were deputed for his feete, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of his body would beare; they muſt be faine to add to the reſt of his torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that other of the rack, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reach: For their particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, who for his ſake ſhould be afflicted in the ſame kind, by the perſecutours of his Church.</p>
               <p>The executioners being there, with their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers and nayles, did extend &amp; ſpread him vpon that hard bed of death; and they tranſpierſt thoſe hands of Charity, and thoſe ſeete of humility, &amp; purity, with ſharpe ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge nayles, driuen in, by a multitude of blowes; making his pretious body the very anuile, whervpon the hammer of our<note n="(c)" place="margin">Our ſinnes were they which crucified our Lord by the hands of the Iewes</note> ſinnes, did by the hands of thoſe crucifiers, beat ſo hard. If any one of them relented, at the ſight of that diuine ſweet ſadnes, through the compaſſion, which ſuch an obiect as that, could not eaſily chooſe but exact, euen of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars; it tended but to the increaſe of his paine. For the more kind they were, the longer they were likely to dwell about doing that office, and ſo the more cruell they fell out to be. If, on the other ſide, as they wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his hands, with theirs, ſo they had alſo in their will, a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:150704:214"/>deſire of his deſtruction, and death; that cruelty and ſinne of their hart, went ſtreight to his; and wounded him worſe, through his loue to them, then, through their hate, they wounded him. So that, whether they were cruell to him, more or leſſe, being conſidered in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, yet in regard of him, all wrought by<note n="(d)" place="margin">All wrought by way of increaſing torment to our Lord.</note> way of increaſing torment.</p>
               <p>The extreme parts of our body, which be our head, our hands, and our feete, haue all thoſe veines, and arteries, and ſinewes, ſhut vp, and as it were, driuen by the direction of nature, into a narrow compaſſe, which goe at eaſe, through larger parts. The fleſhly parts of the body, are dull, in compariſon of thoſe others; and indeed ſo dull, as that, compared with theſe, they can ſcarce, in effect, be ſaid to feele. Yet who is he, that, if (being a perſon of honor) he were content that his fleſh ſhould be pierced, or but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the typ of his eare ſhould be publikely bored through, for anothers fault, would not thinke that he had wrought a kind of wonder of loue. But now, the ſinewes are they, which are truly ſenſible, of ſharpe, and ſtinging paine. Whereof we ſee the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in them who are ſubiect to the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. Which, as it is the thing that makes dogs mad; ſo euen men, are little better, if indeed they haue it in extremity; and all, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome one ſinewe is fretted, by the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of rhewme, which remaines about the roote of a tooth. The torments therfore which our bleſſed Lord endured, as before, by his
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:150704:215"/>Crowne of thornes, ſo now by the nayles of his hands and feet, what were they but great things, which wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a name; ſince they were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in parts, which were the proper ſeates, as a man may ſay, of the ſeſitiue ſoule, where the ſinews meet; &amp; wherby the whole body after a compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, might be moſt afflicted.</p>
               <p>To this let vs add the conſideration of this other truth which was once touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That through the perfection and purity of his complexion, and conſtitution, Chriſt our Lord had incomparably, a quicker ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of feeling, then any creature who euer liued. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, let it be weighed, how he was a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Maiſter of himſelfe, and was neuer to be put to any ſuch ſaynting, as men ſometymes are ſubiect to; who by any great exceſſe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting paine, are brought from any feeling at all, therof. Yea the reaſon of Chriſt our Lord was ſo farre from being tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported in the leaſt degree, as that he felt<note n="(e)" place="margin">Our Lord did feel euery one of his paynes as diſtinctly, as it he had felt but only one.</note> the remainder of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the buffets, which had bene giuen him, and of euery one of the ſtripes of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; of euery one of the thornes of his ſacred head, and of euery one of the nayles of his bleſſed hands and feete, in as diſtinct, and cleere, and ſeuerall a manner, as if he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered but that one only ſingle paine, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it were. So alſo the ſeuerall cauſes which afflicted his minde, did neither yeild to one another, nor drowne nor maiſter them of the body; but euery ſingle griefe of his minde, was as diſtinctly felt as any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone could
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:150704:215"/>be. Wheras when others are ſubiect to ſeuerall paine, and griefe; the maiſter-paine is that which carryes away all their thoughts from the reſt. As a vehement fit of the Goute, or Stone puts away all reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of an ague; and as a very killing griefe of minde, will make a man forget any bodily paine.</p>
               <p>Yet all this paine, or rather all theſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of ſeuerall, and moſt exceſhue corporal paines, (togeather with a cleere beholding of the deadly and vndeſerued malice wherwith they inflicted them vpon him) were not of power, either to winde him vp into the due eſtimation of his owne ſoueraigne dignity, which was ſo prophaned; or to let him down into any diminution of his charity; or to make him behould mankind, (which by their ſinnes muſt all be accompted to haue conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather more or leſſe, to his death) with any other eyes then of endleſſe pitty, though, by inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, they wentin creaſing their cruelty. For howſoeuer a man might thinke, that what they had already done, muſt needs be al which they could doe; and that nothing more remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be deuiſed, which might add to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of our bleſſed Lord; Yet ſee a while, how farre the rage, and wit, of cruelty, and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, is able to reach. For, by<note n="(f)" place="margin">The torments of our Lord ſtill increaſed.</note> rearing the Croſſe vp aloft in the ayre, that it might fall with more ſtrength and force into that hole which had bene made of purpoſe for it in the earth, and that ſo it might be able to ſticke faſt therin; what a diſſolution muſt the whole
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:150704:216"/>frame of the body of our Lord, needs find, in all the ioynts therof.</p>
               <p>Infallibly the parts of his pretious body were all diſioynted. And leaſt it ſhould be thought that this were but a pious, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without further gro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; let it be remembred how <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid of theſe perſecutors, in the perſon of Chriſt our Lord,<note place="margin">Pſalm. <hi>21.</hi>

               <p>Nay his torments were moreouer of that kind, as that during all thoſe full three howers, wherin he was hanging vpon the croſſe, they increaſed of themſelues, by the naturall weight of his owne body. For that weight, made freſh wounds, both in his hands and feete, by making the former grow higher and wider, and the whole frame of his body, more out of ioynt.

And now they were all increaſed, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue cold, which his nakednes gaue him, through his comming ſo lately, from that fire of heate, which his flagellation, his coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his proceſſion, and his creeping, or crawling vp the hill, had caſt him into. And that cold was alſo augmented afterward, by another miraculous accident which was growing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the whole world at once, as I muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew.

               <p>SVCH was the cruelty of all kinds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt our Lord, as he was hanging vpon the Croſſe, and ſuch was the affliction, which in the inferiour part of his ſoule he felt, vpon euery one of thoſe particular paines, and ſcornes. Nor was there ſo much, as one ſingle word, a ſigne, geſture, or a thought of malice, in any one of all thoſe many harts which we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to his, by the way of griefe. Yet ſee alſo how it wrought in the way of loue. As ſoone as the Croſſe was reard, and that already they had ſet al thoſe markes vpon him, which were to carry him to his graue; &amp; that ſtill he was hearing the bitter ſcoffs, &amp; blaſphemies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they prophaned his ſacred eares; he went exerciſing two of his chiefe offices, in a moſt admirable manner, and in a moſt eminent degree.</p>
               <p>Theſe<note n="(a)" place="margin">Our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and the Doctour of our ſoules by by way of inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> were, to be the Mediatour of our Redemption, and the Doctour, in that Chaire of the holy Croſſe, for our inſtruction. He then turned himſelfe in moſt gratious, but moſt dolorous manner to his eternall Father; beſeeching him to forgiue al their ſinnes, who

                  </note> (he in <hi>whome he was well pleaſed</hi>) he might be mercifull to thoſe wretches, whoſe cauſe he had vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to plead. For, howſoeuer they had found in their harts to giue him ſo many wounds of death, with ſo much ſcorne and rage, yet he could not find in his, to forſake them in theyr ſinns, but to begge that they might haue grace to returne by penance. And becauſe he eaſily foreſaw, that the crime was ſo enormous of it ſelfe; his vnſpeakeable charity went ſeeking waies, how to excuſe the grieuouſnes therof, by taking a part from their malice, and aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it to their ignorance who committed it. And he who in that Agony in the Garden, prayed but conditionally, that the bitter Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his puniſhment, might paſſe from him, had ſo much more<note n="(b)" place="margin">Out Lord had far more care of vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> care of them, then of himſelf, as to pray, in abſolute termes, that the Chalice of Gods fury, might not come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Not only he did it in abſolute termes, but he did it, at his death; when Fathers are not wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to refuſe their ſonnes. And he did it more ouer, in the midſt of thoſe exceſſiue torments, when euen enemies vſe to gratify one another: and he did it by way of repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting ſo good a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the obtayning of his ſuite, as wherby
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:150704:221"/>he would conuince, and oblige the Eternall Father to graunt it.</p>
               <p>It was true that they knew not, that he was the naturall Sonne of God; but that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was their fault, and a iuſt puniſhment of blindnes, for their other ſinnes. And the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes which he had done, did manifeſt him to be, what he ſaid he was. And though he had not bene the Sonne of God, yet their owne conſcience told them, that he could not but be a man of God, and of a moſt innocent and holy life; and therfore they ought in reaſon to haue been very farre from intending ſuch a ruine, as they brought him to. There was therfore, much to be ſaid againſt them, &amp; little for them. But yet our Lord, through his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite loue, did let paſſe that much,<note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> and laid hold of that little. And <hi>he was heard by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his reuerence.</hi> And many of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men, were conuerted by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God; and not only many of them, but many millions of our ſoules in after ages are dayly conuerted, in the vertue and ſtrength, of this holy Prayer. Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, this ſoueraigne Doctour did then read ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny leſſons in one. Namely<note n="(c)" place="margin">The inſtuction which is giuen vs by this prayer of Chriſt our Lord.</note> that we muſt excuſe the faults, and much more, the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table caſes, which occurre by way of queſtion, whether or no our neighbours haue done ill; yea and euen we are to pardon our greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, in admiration and imitation of this diuine charity of Chriſt our Lord.

Since therefore we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, being the enemies of God, and who were in all reaſon, to be condemned, to hell fire, for our many and moſt grieuous ſinnes; what rigour ſhall we not deſerue at his hands, if we forgiue not our enemies, for loue of him.</p>
               <p>Now to let vs ſee withall, how farre he was from looſing any thinge in the ſight of God, by induring the bitter paine and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny of the Croſſe; he tells vs, in language plaine inough, that the Father who before, had deliuered all power into his hands, did meane nothing leſſe then to reſume the ſame, and he ſhewed euen then, that he was God. For inſtantly he<note n="(d)" place="margin">The admirable mercy of our Lord to the good Thiefe. <hi>Luc.</hi> 23.</note> ſubſcribed the petition of the Good Thiefe (who rebuked the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his companion, and beſought our <hi>Lord that he would remember him, when he should be in his kingdome</hi>) with ſuch a gratious <hi>Fiat,</hi> and vpon one ſingle, and ſhort requeſt, as may aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly let vs ſee, that we ſerue no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God; &amp; that it coſts him nothing, to giue kingdomes; or rather that it coſts him much; but that he is content to impart them to vs, at an eaſy rate. Yea euen as eaſy as it is to aske, ſo eaſy ſhall it be for vs to haue, if death preuent vs of being able to doe other workes of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And beſides we learne by this, that

               </p>
               <p>O infinite goodnes of our Lord, who had fogotten as it were, to ſpeake when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him to haue anſwered for himſelfe; but who had neuer yet learnt to hold his peace, when his ſpeach might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the comfort &amp; ſaluation of ſuch as deſired the ſame. Hereby we may cleerly find the great force of Grace, which at an inſtant, is able to make a great Saint of the greateſt ſinner. So that, as we may not preſume of Gods mercy at the laſt hower of our life, becauſe we ſee what became of he wicked Thiefe; ſo by the good Thiefes exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple we are bound not to deſpaire therof.

               <p>THERE remayned now a Propheſy, to be fulfilled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the thirſt of our Lord vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe. The torment of extreme h<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, is ſometymes ſo great, as that we read of ſtraite and long ſieges of townes, where the inhabitants haue bene driuen by the rage therof not only to eate vncleane beaſts; but euen mothers, haue deuoured the very childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their owne body; yea and euen the fleſh of their owne Lymms. And yet moſt certain it is, (and we take a kind of taſt therof, by our owne dayly experience) that euery one of vs who haue, at any tyme found our ſelues in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity both of hungar and thirſt, haue felt the thirſt incomparably more troubleſome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hungar.<note n="(a)" place="margin">The great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great thirſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that of hungar</note> Such againe as haue trauelled ſundry dayes, in ſome dry and barren deſerts, (as it hapneth to many, in the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts of the world) ſuch as haue felt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of burning feuers, doe well vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what I ſay. Nor is there almoſt any treaſure v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, which ſome ſuch man would not be glad to giue, for a glaſſe of water. Now thirſt is otherwiſe alſo cauſed, by exceſſe of labour, by heate, by griefe of minde, by payne of body, and eſpecially by the ſpending of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:150704:230"/>much bloud. And we ſeldome let bloud, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are taking Phiſicke (though it be but in ieſt) but it ſerues to giue vs increaſe of thirſt.</p>
               <p>How ardent then muſt the thirſt of Chriſt our Lord needs haue beene; in whome alone, al the cauſes of extreme thirſt did meet? For during all that day, and the whole prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent night, he had bene perpetually in torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, And beſides his Agony, and bloudy ſweat in the garden, he had bene dragged, and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted, and all inflamed, by thoſe cruell ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; thornes. And laſtly he had byn bored through with nayles, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he had now, hunge almoſt three houres, with ſtreames of bloud continually flowing from him; and his ſpirits were exhauſted by a world of deadly ſorrow at his hart, to increaſe his thirſt. This torment he endured, all that while, without once, ſo much as ſaying, that he endured it. Nether did he expreſſe himſelfe now at laſt in this kind, through the delight he meant to take, or paine he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to driue away by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: for already he was, euen vpon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pitch, and brimme of death. And he who in all that tyme, had bene ſwallowing vp the want of drinke, in ſilence; could eaſily haue extended his patience, to thoſe next minutes, which were to be the laſt of his life.</p>
               <p>But<note n="(b)" place="margin">The reaſon why our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his thirſt.</note> this Lord of ours, was preſſed ſo cloſe by his ſpirituall thirſt, of ſuffering as it were infinite things for the loue of vs, and for the gayning, &amp; inſtructing our ſoules, by theſe examples of his inuincible patience; as that it
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:150704:230"/>made him contemne, &amp; euen forget his owne materiall thirſt, though it were to him of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue paine. This Originall of Religious O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which is Chriſt our Lord, doth alſo ſhew heerby, the forme wherin Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to expreſſe themſelues to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. Which<note n="(c)" place="margin">A good leſſon for Religious men.</note> is, not to be, ſo much by way of earneſt deſire, of that which they would haue, as by way of declaration of that, wherof they are in want; and when that is done, the Superiours are to proceed as they ſee cauſe. For ſo did Chriſt our Lord forbeare to deſire to drinke; and he only ſaid, <hi>That he was thirſty,</hi> to thoſe ſouldiers, who were made his Superiours, by his owne admirable humility and charity: ſubmitting himſelfe entirely to their wills who were bribed and bent to doe him all the miſchiefe they could. For when he told them of his thirſt, what was it which they could find in their harts to giue him? The ſame thing which they had offered him before in ieſt, and in the way of ſcorne, the ſame they were content to giue him, now in earneſt, for a concluſion to all their cruell courteſies.</p>
               <p>When they were going to crucify him, they would not giue him wine til it were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered with Gaul,<note place="margin">Matt. <hi>27.</hi> Marc. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note> which is the Embleme of malice and bitternes. And now that he is giuing vp the Ghoſt, they preſent him with a ſpunge full of Vinegar, which is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of rage, and ſowernes. O vncharitable wretches! and who made you, of men, ſuch ſauage monſters? But O infinite Charity and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:150704:231"/>meekenes, and patience of Chriſt our Lord, who accepted of al, without the leaſt reproofe of their impiety. And as at the foote of the Croſſe he had refuſed to drinke of that Gaul, becauſe it was mingled with wine, to the end that he might be ſuffering, whilſt he liued, without any drop of the wine of comfort; yea or ſo much as the being knowne to want it; ſo now, that he was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very point of death, he refuſed not to drinke of that pure vinegar, becauſe it was all ſharpe and ſower.</p>
               <p>He left thoſe draughts which ſhould haue any mixture of comfort in them, with Croſſes, for thoſe Martyrs, whome, he meant to make glorious by following his diuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. And by his taking the vinegar of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, he did conuert it into the wine of ſtrength &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, after a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner to that wherby wicked men are wont, through their ingratitude, to turne the wine of his bleſſings, into the vinegar and Gaul of ſinnes agaynſt him. Abuſing the abundance of his mercy; and making that a motiue of their wicked liberty, which would tye any honeſt hart, ſo much the more inſeparably, to his ſeruice.

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:150704:231"/>meates, wherwith our bleſſed Lord, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make vp his mouth in this mortall life, was but a draught of vinegar, out of a ſponge, at his death.</p>
               <p>By this drinking therfore, he enableth vs to be content, with courſe, and common, and vnpleaſant meat and drinke; and by the merit of his thirſting, after this corporall drinke, he hath killed and quenched our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thirſt after vaine, and vicious delights, which nouriſh and feed vp our ſoules in ſinne.

How infinitely therfore ſhall we be without excuſe, if we giue him not to drinke of our good deeds, ſince he is ſo greedy of them, and was ſo tormented for want therof. Yea, and how worthy ſhall we be of all reproach and paine; if he, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to vs in ſo ſad a Cup, with deſire &amp; thirſt of our good; we ſhall not procure to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him by thirſting, both in body and ſoule, after the aduancing, and increaſing of his Glory.</p>

For loue is the King of all affections, and diſpoſeth of them all, at pleaſure. And amongſt ſeuerall loues, the Superiour loue is ſtill the King, to whom all inferiour loues giue place.

For we<note n="(a)" place="margin">The myſtery of the Paſſion &amp; death of Chriſt our Lord, doth looke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many wayes at once.</note> are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it was not any one onely part, which was repreſented by Chriſt our Lord v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe; but they were very many; &amp; it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes vs much, to marke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. Not only doth the infinite mercy of God ſhine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this miſtery; wherin we ſee that his own increated Sonne was content to dy for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of man; but his infinite Iuſtice alſo,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:150704:242"/>doth no leſſe appeare; ſince it would not be ſatisfied with leſſe then the death of ſuch a Sonne.</p>
               <p>Not only may we heere diſcerne, the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he beareth towards ſinners; but he giueth vs alſo as cleere a proſpect, vpon his vnſpeakeable deteſtation of ſinne; ſince for the aboliſhing therof, he was then to imploy no leſſe then the very death of God. And ſince Chriſt our Lord, being the increated wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Eternall Father, would needs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe all thoſe torments, for the remiſſion &amp; extirpation of ſinne; it is a cleere demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he felt the weight of our ſinnes, more heauily, then he did his bitter and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death; ſince no wiſe man would accept to ſuffer a greater paine, for the excuſing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which were leſſe. So that, as by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and charity of God, which is ſo liuely expreſt in the crucifixion of our Lord IESVS, we are obliged to loue him, and to imitate his Humility and his Charity; ſo by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Maieſty of God which we may diſcerne, and of the high purity of his nature, and his great hate of ſinne, we are taught to reuere him, and to tremble,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> and to carry firme reſolutions to ſerue him with all fidelity, and care; and rather to dy a thouſand tymes, then once to preſume to offend him in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>S. Paul declareth to vs, that <hi>Deus erat in Chriſto, mundum reconcilians ſibi; The</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>The way to heauen is a hard and narrow way, and few will diſpoſe themſeues to walke in it; but the way to perdition, is a wide and eaſy way, and it will be walked in by many.</hi>
               </p>

This meanes, conſiſteth in our meeting with God, in the perſon of IESVS Chriſt our only Lord. For as God deſcended downe by him, ſo by him, we muſt aſcend vp towards God.

               <p>The deſire of Chriſt our Lord, is to rayſe vs thither, according to his own diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

His reſolution was, that his workes ſhould ſpeake of him, and ſo they did; and this was alſo the caſe of our Bleſſed Lady, who as ſhe was next him in grace, ſo was ſhe alſo next him in humility.</p>

               <p>I will firſt, in a word, point out the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and prayſes of this perpetuall Virgin which are mentioned in holy Scripture, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as they ere raunged togeather by <hi>Caniſius,</hi>

And ſo if any one ſoule had all that Grace which is in all created ſoules, any one mortall ſinne would inſtantly expell it all.</p>
               <p>Not only doth it remoue deformity, but it indues the ſoule with ſuch exceſſiue beauty, as makes it, of odious to God, and obnoxious to the eternall fires of hell, moſt dearly amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight, of that diuine Maieſty; and it giues it tytle, and right to the kingdome of heauen.

She had formerly vnderſtood therof, in the holy Scriptures; but now vpon the words of the Angell, ſhe cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbraced, with her belefe, the perſon of the Father, from whome the Sonne was to be ſent; the perſon of the Sonne whome ſhe was to conceaue; &amp; the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, who was to worke that high myſtery in her.

               <p>This meane conceipt of her ſelfe, the moſt ſacred Virgin, made appeare, when ſhe was told by the Angell in the name of God,

               <p>When other creatures are prayſed they ſeldome ſend the prayſes backe as cleane as they come, but their mindes being moyſtned by ſelfe-loue, are ſtill retayning ſome impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therof more or leſſe: <hi>Lumen ſiccum optimae anima.</hi> It is an excellent choice ſoule which ſo flameth vp towards God as not to be ſoftned or ſteeped in humaine affections. It was, with our B.

               <p>If ſuch were the perfection of her Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of hart, at that tyme, (which I would to Chriſt, we did not want words ſo much as to name) what would it grow to be, after ſo long cohabitation with that God, her ſonne, for the ſpace of tree, and thirty yeares?

               <p>I adore God, in his B.
